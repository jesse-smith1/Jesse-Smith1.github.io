      <h1> Long term goal?</h1>
      <p class = "BoxMe">
        Hmmmm, well to start off I want to be able to look at a code and be able to understand it, why it’s working, how it is working, what  it does. Which is what’s starting to happen. I still have the goal of working in mobile apps and “debugging” process of coding which I’m really excited about.
      </p>

      <h2 class="BoxMe"> What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>
      <p class="BoxMe">

      I think now my strength is actually persistence and curiosity, I’m doing nearly 12 hours of coding a day 6 - 7 days a week and its already starting to pay off 
      I’m really happy with what I’ve learnt so far. I think asking for help in that chat is still a limitation for me as i’m a face to face person, it’s Sunday 
      right now and I don’t know if anyone is still working on their assignments like me so I’m not asking in the chat if anyone else has the "event is deprecated" when a new line of code is added, this has ended up taking most of my time currently trying to figure out what that means and why it only sometimes happens.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="BoxMe">What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h2>
      
      <p class="BoxMe">

       I think it will be self confidence and self sabotage, I know I can learn all of this stuff, but I don’t think I will be as fast as some of the others and I don’t want to be the person that’s slowing everyone else down.
      </p>

      <p class="BoxMe>">What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </p>
      <p> I really want to improve my ability to receieve feeback, goes for negative and Positive, I know I struggle with how to respond to compliments. Also maybe working on confidence when talking to people "online"? Throughout the foundations coarse I have found it really awkward but i'm not sure if that is even something you can teach. </p>
      <h2 class="BoxMe">What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?
       What does support look like to you?
      </h2>
      
      <p class="BoxMe">If I’m stuck, I’m a visual learner, so seeing how things are done are a lot easier than reading something and imagining how to do it then doing it.</p>
      
      <h3 class="BoxMe"> What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3>
      
      <p class="BoxMe">
        To be able to look at my own code or someone else’s and understand what is actually happening, if there is an error, to understand why the error occurred, then from there work to fix it. So, when I do need help i'll go to other learners and/or coaches for advice. Mainly face to face. I set a timer for 30 minutes then go for a 5 minute break however during foundations because of the hours there, I'll most likely stick to their schedule and during the lunch break go for much needed exercise so that I can take a mental break.
        </p> 







     <h2 class = "BoxMe">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>

      <p class="BoxMe">
        Short Term I want to be able to get the basics of coding.
        Long term I want a job in creating mobile gaming app. In particular apps on phone, mainly the back-end of programming not the front-end.
      </p>
      
     <h2 class="smaller-header">A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h2>
      
      <p class="BoxMe">
        Strength would be problem solving and I like how there are multiple ways of doing the same thing.
       Limitation - Not knowing the more efficient way of doing certain things.
     </p>
      
     <h2 class="smaller-header">What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
      
      <p class="BoxMe">
        Self Confidence. Because this is so new to me I’m not used to being real amateur at something but I guess you have to start somewhere.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="smaller-header">A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h2>
    
      
      <p class="BoxMe">
        Lately what has been working for me and I will continue is get all the information out first even if its only the tinniest bit relevant, once that’s done I go through the material with a fine comb and cut out all the fat so I have relevant information. Then make it make sense, and finally work on the end touches.
        I also write a todo list with small tasks so I don’t forget.
        When things are building up it’s always nice to confide in someone even if it’s my nephews who are 2 years old and don’t understand any concept. For me sometimes it’s just nice to have someone listen but not say anything. But when they’re not around I tend to just talk to the closest person next to me and ask for help.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="smaller-header">A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h2>
      
      <p class="BoxMe">
        Generally, I seek help all the time with anyone that I think will be able to help and that’s usually after a real attempt has been made, I explain what I have done to get where I am at and where I think the problem is.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="smaller-header">A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h2>
      
      <p class="BoxMe">
        When I need help I would like for them to point me in the right direction not give me the answer straight up, I can go 100%, but the thing with going 100% is I can go 100% in the wrong way. Being directed in the right path is more useful to me when I know I have the resources.

      </p>
      
     <h2 class="smaller-header">Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h2> 
      
      <p class="BoxMe">
        I’m getting to the age now where I don’t have a social life and I live with my family, so we don’t really go anywhere. I have no commitments outside of school currently.
