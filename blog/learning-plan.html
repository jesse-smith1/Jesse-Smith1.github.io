     <h1>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h1>

      <p>Short Term I want to be able to get the basics of coding.
      Long term I want a job in creating mobile gaming app. In particular apps on phone.</p>
      
     <h2>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h2>
      
      <p>Strength would be problem solving and I like how there are multiple ways of doing the same thing.
      Limitation - Not knowing the more efficient way of doing certain things.</p>
      
     <h2>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
      
      <p>Self Confidence. Because this is so new to me I’m not used to being real amateur at something but I guess you have to start somewhere.</p>
      
      <h2>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h2>
    
      
      <p>Lately what has been working for me and I will continue is get all the information out first even if its only the tinniest bit relevant, once that’s done I go through the material with a fine comb and cut out all the fat so I have relevant information. Then make it make sense, and finally work on the end touches.
      I also write a todo list with small tasks so I don’t forget.
      When things are building up it’s always nice to confide in someone even if it’s my nephews who are 2 years old and don’t understand any concept. For me sometimes it’s just nice to have someone listen but not say anything. But when they’re not around I tend to just talk to the closest person next to me and ask for help.</p>
      
      <h2>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h2>
      
      <p>Generally, I seek help all the time with anyone that I think will be able to help and that’s usually after a real attempt has been made, I explain what I have done to get where I am at and where I think the problem is.</p>
      
      <h2>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h2>
      
      <p>When I need help I would like for them to point me in the right direction not give me the answer straight up, I can go 100%, but the thing with going 100% is I can go 100% in the wrong way. Being directed in the right path is more useful to me when I know I have the resources.</p>
      
     <h2>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
    </h2> 
      
      <p>I’m getting to the age now where I don’t have a social life and I live with my family, so we don’t really go anywhere. I have no commitments outside of school currently.</p>
