  <h1>Describe the difference between EQ and IQ</h1>

   <p class="BoxMe"> 
     IQ is about your cognitive ability, this involves processing memory, knowledge and reasoning. You may be the best person in your field as you have a high IQ but are horrible at working with other people. 
     EQ is more about your sense of emotions, this Involves controlling, identifying and using emotions. You may not have the highest IQ, how ever you are able to work in a team well and together are able to produce the same quality if not better quality of work than a singular person who has high IQ but low EQ.
   </p>

<h2 class="smaller-header">Describe why EQ is important and how it is relevant to you</h2>

   <p class="BoxMe">
     From experience, working with people who are able to recognise other peoples emotions especially stress levels has been more helpful to me then someone who knows what to do, ignores how you feel and continues to push on. 
     It really makes a huge difference, even if you are having a bad day at work to know that your team has got your back, this makes you want to actually go to work and work harder.
