     <h1>Describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS.</h1>

      <p class="BoxMe">
        Javascript is how you “interact” with everything on your web page.HTML is your content and CSS is the styling.Example: You have a red button that opens a door. The button and the door existing at all is the HTML. 
        The CSS would be what makes the button look red and big and Javascript would be the “interaction” (the action of “using” the button and opening the door.)
      </p>

  <h3 class="smaller-header">Explain control flow and loops using an example process</h3>
      
     <h3 class="smaller-header">Control flow</h3>
       <p class="BoxMe">
        Is the flow of control, where the computer uses instructions it has been given. It follows the instructions in order from the first line of instructions to the last line of instructions (note: you can change this if you have an instruction that tells the computer to change its course).
        <br> 
        An example of Control Flow:
        <br>
        You want a quick breakfast (toast) before work.
        <br>
        Your instructions would be to:
        <br>
        1. Get your bread
        <br>
        2. Insert your bread into toaster
        <br>
        3. Press start
        <br>
        4. When toast is finished toasting, grab your toast.
        <br>
        <br>
        By making your breakfast in this order you have followed the flow of control (Control Flow).
      </p>

      <h3 class="smaller-header">Loops</h3>

        <p class="BoxMe">
         A loop is when you have a set of instruction(s) that you want to repeat itself until you want it to finish.

         Example:

         If say in a perfect world you wanted to lose 10kgs in a day and in this world you could lose 1kg doing 1 press-up.
   
         Your instructions to lose 10kg in a day would be to: “Do 1 press up” 10 times.
          <br>
         With a loop, this instruction would repeat itself:
          <br>
         Do 1 press up
          <br>
         Do 1 press up
          <br>
         Do 1 press up
          <br>
         Do 1 press up
          <br>
         Do 1 press up
          <br>
         Do 1 press up
          <br>
         Do 1 press up
          <br>
         Do 1 press up
          <br>
         Do 1 press up
          <br>
         Do 1 press up
          <br>
          <br>
         And the loop would finish once you have done 10 “Do 1 press ups” because you told yourself you only wanted to lose 10kgs that day, therefore doing 10 press ups = losing 10kgs.
         </p>

     <h3 class="smaller-header">Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</h3>
       
     <p class="BoxMe">
         I googled the DOM so you didnt have to.
         <br>   
         <br>
         The google definition I found was “The Document Object Model (DOM) is an application programming interface (API) for HTML and XML documents. It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated.”
         <br>
         <br>
         But I got lost in that explanation so.. basically, The DOM is like a directory in the form of a virtual tree that also lets us (as programmers) to access and change pretty much every aspect of an HTML document (web page).
     </p>

        <img src="../styles/DOM tree.png">

     <p class="BoxMe">
        You would use the DOM as a directory to find something that you are looking for. Once you have found what you are looking for, from there you can make your changes to it.
     </p>
  
    <h3 class="smaller-header">Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h3>  

     <p class="BoxMe">
        To understand how to access data from both arrays and objects first I would have liked to know what an array and an object are and what they look like (as I am a very visual learner)
        An array is like a container that holds a list of similar data types that can be accessed by referencing to where it is within the array. Each piece of data is given an index (a number) that later if you need to find it, you can reference your array followed by the index number.
        Arrays start count from 0.
        <br>
        Example:
      </p>

      <img src="../styles/Array eg.png">
      <br>

      <p class="BoxMe">
        The name of the Array is “Tree. The list of data is stored within the [ ]  ( [ ] usually signifies an array) in this example we have [‘Pōhutukawa’,  ‘Rimu’, ‘Kōwhai’].
        The index that has been assigned to the data type ([‘Pōhutukawa’,  ‘Rimu’, ‘Kōwhai’]) starts count from 0. In this case 
        Pōhutukawa = 0
        Rimu = 1
        Kōwhai = 2
        <br>
        Using this example again, to access information in the array, first you want to name the array you are looking for (note: there will most likely be more then 1 array in your HTML document (web page) which I guess is why the array needs to have a name) which is Tree.
      
        Followed by the index number of the data type (in this case Pōhutukawa  Rimu and ‘Kōwhai is the data type) that you are looking for.
      
        So if I were to look for the Kōwhai data. I would use Tree[2]
      </p>

      <br>
      
      <p class="BoxMe">
        Object.
        <br>
        An object is also like a container but this one can hold different data types for one specific thing and instead of index numbers being assigned to your data to reference and find your information you have a Key-Value pair.
      
        An object when written looks like:
      </p>
 
      <img src='../styles/Name of Object.png'>
      
      <p class="BoxMe">An example could be a person which would look like:</p>

      <img src="../styles/person example.png">
      
      <p class="BoxMe">
        To access information inside of an object we use dot notation, in the example above if I needed to find the age of this particular person I would use:
        <br>
       (person.Age);
      
       First you specify the object I(n this case would be “person” ) followed by a ‘.’ Followed by the key (in this case it would be Age) and it will give you the value (100) of the key (Age).
      </p class="BoxMe">

  <h3 class="smaller-header">Explain what functions are and why they are helpful.</h3>

    <p class="BoxMe">
      A Function is a set of instructions of code that you create once that you can reuse anytime you need to reuse it instead of writing out something multiple times.
