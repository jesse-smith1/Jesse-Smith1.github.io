        <h1>
          Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</h1>


        <p>The situation I’ll use now that I have thought about and reflected on, I’m not sure If I was doing someone a favour or put simply got scammed ha, nonetheless I was walking to work years ago and this man came up to me and he told me that he had no phone and no money , that the airport bus dropped him off at the railway station and he only had an address written down on a piece of paper. He asked me if I knew where “pow ree roo wa” (Porirua) was. I said yes but I am on my way to work so he asked if I had any money to help him get to his “cousins” house. At the time I was making I think $11.90 an hour (yes this sounds horrible and it was.. but so is inflation). At this point I’m thinking in my head  I have to pay rent but also if I was stuck in the same situation I would need someone to help me. So I took him to the ATM ,gave him $20 and pointed him  in the right direction to get a train but from there he was going to need to ask for specific directions to where he was going.
Maybe a few years later, by chance I was working at a coffee shop and the same guy came into the store and had remembered me for giving him money to get to where ever he was going, he ended up giving me back my $20 and thanked me for helping him out. Now that I have rethought and reflected on it I reckon he probably lived in Porirua and just forgot his wallet, the chances of someone running into each other again like that when they’re from another country on holiday is like what 0.00001% chance? I do not hold a grudge against him as this happened when I was 19 but even today if someone did the same thing I would probably buy them a ticket (within reason) to get home or to someone they know, maybe even use a phone to call someone they know. I am a strong believer in it is better to give than to receive.

<p>Well, my story is a little different to most Pacifica people. I was adopted when I was a child, as well as two other of my siblings. My parents are Palagi (caucasian) as is my eldest brother and sister. I have two other sisters who are also adopted, one is Fijian / Indian, the other is Samoan / Chinese and I am Samoan.
  Growing up and going through high school was hard for me to “fit in” (like most teenagers). I didn’t fit the model of “Pacific Islander” - I didn’t speak the language, I didn’t have the same values, I wasn’t related in any way to anyone else at the school. Most of the P.I guys would ask why do I sound “white”?, What I did have in common was that I looked Pacific Islander, my older sisters looked Pacific Islander but there was this huge void of unknowingness between us and I think that’s where all the confusion for them came from.
  Fast forward 2 years and I dropped out of high school and I went into the work force, I ended up sharpening my social and empathic skills through hospitality (this was happening naturally as I wasn’t going to work to specifically refine these skills). Fast forward 10 years and I realise how blessed I am to have the family I have, through all these experiences and the diversity of my family. I have learnt that EVERYONE is different, everyone has their own story, everyone is going at their own pace and you don’t have to fit into a certain “model”. Looking back to my past I now appreciate when I see diversity and inclusion of all people and that is something I value.

<h3 class="smaller-header">Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</h3>

<p>I am adaptable meaning I work well if not better in a team environment, I have years of experience through my professional life working with people who have different perspectives, ideas, cultures, genders, and backgrounds. Working with people with differences has allowed me to sharpen my problem solving skills especially when it comes to conflict of interests. I am also self aware, for material that I am familiar with I know what I am capable of and the areas that need improvement and for material that I am new to, if I’m genuinely not into it. 1) I won’t attempt it or 2) I will try it just to confirm if I was right that I don’t like it ( Yes I have assumed wrong before). If I am genuinely interested in it, curiosity for learning new material takes over and I can spend hours at a time learning and absorbing. These skills have already supported and will continue to support me throughout this coarse as I also learn from other peoples strategies, their mistakes, what worked for them and ideas to mould my own goal.</p>

<h4 class="smaller-header">Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</h4>

<p>I have ADD, so distraction and loss of concentration has always been an issue for me, sometimes it feels like I am going everywhere and nowhere at the same time Ha. How ever I had heard that there is something called brown noise that when someone with ADHD / ADD listens to it, it helps to block all racing thoughts. In my particular situation it has helped me although there is no scientific backing to this and I don’t know if it is a placebo effect or not but it seems to work for myself. On the other side of having ADD I sometimes have hyper concentration which is polar to loss of concentration and I can tunnel vision (do not realise that I am only seeing or working only on the smaller picture). I am aware of it therefore can step back and “snap out of it”.
With self confidence, there are times that I have missed out on opportunities because I have not had the confidence to take on the challenge but as I am older now it is one of those things you realise you have to face to get literally anywhere. 
In terms of affecting my learning journey though I believe it is a blessing border lining a curse in the way it has its positives and negatives, knowing my self confidence I now have something to prove and with having ADD I think that in itself has given me an advantage to being able to adapt to new situations as I gravitate towards new stimuli.</p>

<h5 class="smaller-header">Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h5>

<p>Recently at my last job I was leading a team of Care Co-ordinators. (My team had to find Support Workers to go to high needs clients ranging from cerebal palsy to giving clients their medication throughout ALL of New Zealand). The thing with healthcare and clients with high needs is that high needs clients always need to come first as there is a fair chance of injury and in some cases death. I had a client that needs 24/7 care with 2 Support workers and with clients like these they need to have a team and a contingency plan. Well, one of the Support workers decided to call in sick for their “Wakeover” shift (A wakeover shift is where someone will go to a clients house and stay awake the whole night to make sure the client is safe). I had called all of the Support workers in this clients team and in their contingency plan (this usually includes 30+ support workers). All had declined the shift even though in their contract it states if you have signed to be on someones contingency plan you must attend.
This is when the stress starts to set in, you need to find someone to take over this shift, you now have 45minutes left, you can’t force people to attend clients, you don’t want to call emergency services to make a social admission, you aren’t the boss of these support workers so you have no authority over them and your own team have exhausted all of their resources and are staying late to help this one person.
  <br>
So what did I do?… I cried silently at my desk.. 
  <br>
  <br>
No I didn’t but believe me I really wanted to. 
  <br>
What I had to do was what we call “roster stripping” (this is where you “back track” and find Support workers who have gone to clients in the past and strip their roster so they are available to take a shift then call their original clients to let them know you have to find another Support Worker to fill in the gap you just created). I found one Support worker whom  had attended this client before where they specifically requested NOT to do a Wakeover shift as this particular client was uncomfortable having a male awake and turning them around while they were asleep. They also had a High Needs client with a wakeover shift so I couldn’t just call them and ask if they can attend this client instead,. So, I called the support worker (Lets call him D) and ask if he can take on my clients Wakeover shift and he explains he will do it if I can cover his shift but also that he will only do the sleepover shift NOT the wakeover. I call D’s current clients Wakeover team who thankfully accepted the shift for D.  call the client that D was supposed to attend for that night to let them know the change of roster.
I then call the original High needs clients Sleepover Support worker and let them know I can only find someone for the sleep over shift, Thank the lord the Support Worker knew what situation I was in and said she would do the wake over.
  <br>
We call the client to let them know they have cover for tonight.
  <br>
Looking back now, I think I would have escalated to my own manager or to the on call nurse to probably deal with this but also I wouldn’t have had the job I had if the company I worked for didn’t think I could handle situations like this, on a regular basis. How ever If I had more time I would have liked to hear of all the strategies my team used before they escalated to me incase I was doing exactly the same thing someone else tried.</p>
