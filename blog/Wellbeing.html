    <h1> Well being</h1>

    
    <p>How accurate were your expectations of your learning needs and growth areas?</p>
    <p> Pretty fair, I knew I had more growths than learning needs.</p>
    <br>
  </p>Were there any surprises / did you learn new things about yourself?</p>
  <p>Yeah im surprised that after such a short amount of time I now use jargon that I didnt use earlier and understand
    that the way devs talk with that jargon isnt to sound impressive but the words they use like deprecation, itterate, functionality
    is literally what they mean. I have learnt that I ignore things that I shouldnt and approach situations more with
    an open mind even though I dont enjoy it, my immediate thought of something because of past situations doesnt mean
    that it applies to all similar events that present themselves.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>  What challenges did you find in following your learning and wellbeing plan?</p>
  <p> I struggled with persistence and patience in some instances, some things were just too hard that I procrastinated
    and didnt ask for help that I learnt on my own after weeks of trying.
  </p>
  
  <br>
  <p>What benefits did you experience from following your learning and wellbeing plan?</p>
  <p>definitlely comparing myself to myself as I was from when I started foundations, I have improved so much I truly feel like 
    an actual coder, whether or not im a good one thats a different story but im taking the win for sure.
