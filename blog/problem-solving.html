    <h1>Blocked on a simple problem:</h1>
    <p class="BoxMe">
      One problem that I have (and I say “I have” because at the moment I still haven’t come to a solution). Is the question 

      This function takes a sentence, which is a string.
      It needs to .map() over every word in that sentence and Capitalize The First Letter Of Every Word.
      The function should return the modified sentence as a string.
      
    </p>
    
    <p class="BoxMe">
      Below is a snippet of my journal that I use to record my thoughts and ideas of what could work and how I would approach so bare in mind of spelling mistakes and what not cause I was not intending on sharing this journal but its not a personal one so I don’t mind. It will just give you an idea on may thought processes: 
    </p>
    
     <p class="BoxMe">
       “…I know it where it needs to end I just don’t know where to start.
      So far I’m googling how does the map method work.

      Maybe I should learn how to capitalise a word first, then learn how to use the map method and then see if I can make every word have capital letters.
      From there find a way to capitalise only the first letter (I have a feeling a string may have an index number associated with it.Most of the examples use map methods when using numbers…

      Map method goes through arrays like a loop and gives out another array? (Solution?) how do I connect that with function capitalise (string) if the method() looks like variable.method(function(argument?)) is “argument supposed to be the same as the string that you’re passing through function capitalize (string)?”

      Currently my gut is telling me I’m going in the right direction, how ever the examples of .map() (through googling) is giving me mixed codes so I’m trying to decipher what part is necessary, nothing google that I have searched so far has similarity with the preset function that we start off with.
    </p>
    
      <p class="BoxMe">
        What I have learnt from this is I know what outcome it needs, I need to learn how to get there, specifically, “How do I know when to use a loop? How do I know when to declare a variable inside a function? Can map method work better than looping in THIS instance?

      </p>
    
      <h2 class = "BoxMe">Elegantly solved a problem.</h2>
    
   <p class="BoxMe">
        First I’ll just state I don’t think I have elegantly solved a problem, but problems have been solved through curiosity on how things work.
I did have a problem though with adding someones scores to their name using dot notation.
Firstly I started by guessing, (like I always do) then by trial and error. When testing (using the npm test [insert-test-name]  the error that comes up gives you a lot of detail. At first I had no idea what any of this sh!t meant, but then one of the tutors gave a talk at 2pm and no one was asking questions so I just had to make it less awkward by asking, when something comes back as “undefined” what does that mean and how do I know where the error is occurring.
Gerard (the host of this “seminar”) went through how to identify what was “expected” and what was “received”. That in itself is a great starting point so you can go back and make certain adjustments to your code.
Then trial and error to the end baby!
I have learnt that making mistakes is actually a really good stepping stone, if you make a mistake you need to find where your issue has occurred. When you know  where the issue is occurring you have a more specific research starting point as opposed to researching a topic as a whole and then trying to learn everything about a topic.

   <h3 class="BoxMe">Reflect on how confident you feel using problem-solving techniques/processes:</h3>
    
    <p class="BoxMe">
      <strong>Pseudocode</strong>
      <br>
    This is really helpful however with using // I like to write ALOT about random things (as you can probably tell) so pseudocode will eventually get REALLY annoying for anyone else.
    <br>
    <strong>Trying something</strong>
    <br>
    Yeah I do trial and error all the time, even when I know it’s not going to work, if and when it doesn’t work, I’ve learnt that aint gonna work. 
    <br>
    <strong>Rubber ducky method</strong>
    <br>
    I dont use a rubber ducky but I do tell my 2 and 4yr old nephews, which helps because they always ask what is this what is that, (not that they have an interest in learning what im trying to tell them but on the chance that they ask what something is and if I can explain it to them without second guessing my explanation I know im starting to have a solid foundation on how something works.
    <br>
    <strong>Reading error messages</strong>
    <br>
    Only just starting to get the gist of it, I need to code a lot more to see different instances of where an issue is occurring but as a whole I’m pretty happy with seeing that there is an error, and the area of where the error is happening just not immediately being able to pinpoint where the error is coming from.
    <br>
    <strong>Console.logging</strong>
    <br>
    I probably don’t use this as often as I should be but I know it’s real handy to have. 
    <br>
    <strong>Googling</strong>
    <br>
    Every day, every hour, every minute - nough said ha
    <br>
    <strong>Asking your peers for help</strong>
    <br>
    At first I had an issue with it but now I don’t care, if you see it from a coach / teacher / trainer / tutor point of view, if you don’t ask for help they and your peers are just going to assume that you’ve grasped the concept. 
    <br>
    <strong>Asking coaches for help.</strong>
    <br>
    I have no issue with asking them for help as I know they’re happy to help and they do.
    <br>
    <strong>Improving your process with reflection</strong>
    <br>
    I think I could take some time at the end of the day just to reflect specifically on how far I’ve come and appreciate where I’m currently at because its for sure better then where I was at with coding before this coarse.
    <br>
   </p> 
  
   <h4 class ="BoxMe">Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so.</h4>

   <p class = "BoxMe">
    It was the first week I think, it’s just real awkward when you don’t know anyone and you know no one knows anyone and first impressions are big man. You don’t want to come off stupid and you don’t wanna come off being a know-it-all. But now I just ask questions when I don't understand something it just makes it easier, and I would also rather ask the "silly" questions now then do it in the professional world where people will actually treat you like shit haha
