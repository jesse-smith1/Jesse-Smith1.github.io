    <h1>Reflection on Foundations</h1>

    
    <p class="BoxMe">
      What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?   
     </p> 
     
     <p class="BoxMe">
      - I am more aware of having a feeling as opposed to just having that feeling (I know that I am feeling stressed instead of just being stressed and doing nothing about it.

      - I am comparing myself  to others less and comparing myself to myself as I was when I started,and as a result I’m getting excited as to where I could be. 

      - I have learnt to be more comfortable being uncomfortable to learn more (eg: asking for help in a very public forum)
     </p>
        
     <p class="BoxMe">
      What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?
    </p>
        
      
    <p class="BoxMe"> 
      Taking myself as an example, values, empathy and self-awareness are all included in the growth mindset. I think your values is what’s going to be your drive, your empathy is going to be able to help you work in a team, and your self-awareness is going to help you stay sane.
</p>
 <p class="BoxMe">
  What has surprised you the most about the core learning? 
        </p>
        <p class="BoxMe">
          That it actually helps, to be honest, at first I did have that mindset of why are we even learning it (only because I thought naturally I have all of these qualities.
        </p>
      <p class="BoxMe">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</p>
<p class="BoxMe">Definitely comparing myself to others has been the hardest thing for me, and accepting that my journey is different to theirs. </p>
<p class="BoxMe">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</p>
   <p class="BoxMe">Mmmmm, I think cause you can be this awesome coder but the worst person to work with, I know from experience that if I was an employer I would go with someone that has less technical skills (that can be taught on the job) who is able to work well in a team. Than the most perfect coder who can’t work well in a team (that is a harder thing to teach in a job especially when its not the focus of the job) I have worked with people like that before and they make the job harder than it needs to be.
    Even  if we get to the solution we needed the process with that sort of person is REALLY stressful and creates almost like this void between the team and this one person and then a whole other set of problems starts from there. 
    </p>
<p class="BoxMe">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</p>
<p class="BoxMe">If this was asked of me before I learnt everything in core then I would have felt like its a waste of time, but unless you’ve actually experienced people who have literally no “people” skills, (I’m sure everyone will be exposed to that in one form or another in their lifetime) then you’re not gonna know how important it actually is, also being aware that you might actually be “that person”,(I wonder if anyone comes to that conclusion and had that revelation) is going to help you, not just in a professional setting but in nearly every setting.  The thing with core skills, is that you don’t “prove” you have core skills by writing it on paper or showing what you can do, for me its like a behaviour that people pick up on without actively looking for it.</p>
