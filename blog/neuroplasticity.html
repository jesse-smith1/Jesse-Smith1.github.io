<h1>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.</h1>

  <p class="BoxMe">
    If you understand what Neuroplasticity is, you may recognise that you there is an option to “strengthen or create new neuron pathways”. 
    For instance if you are aware when you are learning a new skill and you start off by being bad at it, instead of thinking you can’t do this.. this is too hard.. you can change your mindset to something like “I am aware that I am bad however this is because I am creating new connections in my brain”. You know that because your brain is creating new connections  they are going to start off weak first but the more and more you expose yourself to new skills and experiences the stronger the connection will become.
    
    
    It can restore old, lost connections and functions that have not been used in some time, enhance memory, and even enhance overall cognitive skills.
  </p>
    
  <p class="BoxMe">Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit.</p>
    

  <p class="BoxMe">
    Learn a new skill, (at the moment obviously I am learning to code and each day I know my knowledge of coding is growing, not as advanced  as other people but 3 weeks ago if I had to do what we are doing right now I would have no clue what to do as I would not have made any neuro pathways in my brain for this particular skill. Now I know that there is a connection, it is just a matter of strengthening that connection.
  </p>
     

  <p class="BoxMe">
    What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</p>
    

  <p class="BoxMe">
    Repetition, or even learning new material that is relevant to learning a new skill (example: If you were to learn a new language like Spanish and you learnt to say Hello, you could learn “new material that is relevant” by learning “Hello, how are you” . Same skill : new material.

<h2 class="BoxMe">Growth Mindset</h2>
 
    
  <p class="BoxMe"> What it is and why it is relevant.</p>
    

   <p class="BoxMe">
      In Laymen terms I would say its giving yourself a can-do attitude but also being able to recognise where you start off and through hard work and effort you can continualy grow your skills and abillities.
  </p>
  

    <p class="BoxMe">In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</p>
    
    
    <p class="BoxMe">
      I think this growth mindset came to me quite naturally throughout this journey because this is something that I want to do long term although I didn’t know that there was a name for it. I do know looking back that when I was at college, I did NOT have this mindset, so it is interesting to see how I am approaching education now that I am older than when I was younger.
    </p>
     
    <p class="BoxMe">How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</p>
      
    <p class="BoxMe"> believe I already have, so currently when I have run into problems and have that voice saying, this is too hard, I can’t do this, is it worth me even doing this? 
    I remind myself I have a goal (I have actually never really been a goal orientated person either so this is new to me, I’ve always been a go with the flow type of person and that has not gotten me anywhere I want to be.), that I am learning a new skill that I want to be good at. Ask for help when I get stuck (after I’ve made a good attempt).
    I also remind myself how much I have improved from when I first started, I can recognise already some of the things on the HTML wise what I want to change as when I first started I kinda just chucked in random code and hoped for the best and it works but there are easier ways to do the same thing AND it looks cleaner.
    One last thing is (and everyone does this naturally) is don’t compare yourself to others, yes it’s cringe to read, but it’s true. When I started my blog I was comparing it to what everyone else was doing and that was a HUGE cut to my confidence, but I know that other people have way more experience than I do so I am really happy with the improvement I have made myself. “Compare yourself to yourself as you were yesterday”.

    <p class="BoxMe">Blend with your learning plan and strategies</p>
    
    <p class="BoxMe">Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.</p>
    
    <p class="BoxMe">I think, knowing where you have started, where you want to be and especially where you are at the moment is really important on your learning journey.
    If you know where you are at the moment, you know what you can work on, what you’re good at. If you know where you started, you can see how much you have improved. If you know where you want to be and know it’s worth it, you’ll work hard to achieve it. When you hit those road blocks, keep reminding yourself that you’re learning, look back at what you did at the start. Its a success in itself to take the step of starting a new career for me.
